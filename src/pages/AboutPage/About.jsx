          I am currently studying frontend development remotely at
          Folkuniversitetet GÃ¶teborg. I have always been interested in
          programming and purchased my first HTML & CSS book around the age of
          15. However, I found it a bit challenging at that time and put it on
          hold until recently when I resumed my studies. Now, programming and
          problem-solving occupy most of my thoughts, and I endeavor to learn
          something new every day. Presently, I am particularly focused on
          improving my design skills.
